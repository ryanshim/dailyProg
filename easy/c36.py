r/dailyprogrammer [Easy] Challenge 36:

1000 Lockers Problem.
In an imaginary high school there exist 1000 lockers labelled 1, 2, ..., 1000.
All of them are closed. 1000 students are to "toggle" a locker's state. * The first
student toggles all of them * The second one toggles every other one 
(i.e, 2, 4, 6, ...) * The third one toggles the multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, ...) 
and so on until all students have finished.

 How many and which lockers are open in the end?
